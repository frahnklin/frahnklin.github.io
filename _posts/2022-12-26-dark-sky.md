With January 1st approaching, I figured it's about time to talk about Dark Sky and Apple Weather.

Dark Sky is my favorite weather app, hands-down, and it was very accurate and reliable while it lasted.
Why do I say "while it lasted"? Well, the app is no more. At least in five days from now it will be no more.

In case you don't know about the situation, let's start with the background. Released in 2012, Dark Sky was
once available for $3.99 on both iOS and Android devices. On March 31, 2020, Apple bought Dark Sky and informed
users in a blogpost [here](https://blog.darksky.net). Soon after, in August of 2020, the Android app was
shut down for good. Thankfully for us iOS users, the app wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. We had until
the end of 2022 so there's plenty of... time. Huh, would you look at that! The end of 2022 is here! Uh-oh.

I know what you're going to say now. "I've never used Dark Sky. How good could it possibly be?" Well. That's
your first mistake: not having used the app. The app is quite possibly the best weather app, ever. For starters,
it has precipitation notifications, daily weather notifications, extreme weather notifications, and even umbrella
and suncreen reminder notifications! Oh, and may I add, color-coordinated precipitation and temperature maps, hour-by-hour 
forecasts up to a week in the future, and even a way to see past temperatures (and even future ones, however
unreliable that may be). I know what you're thinking: "Franklin, Apple's weather app has all that." And that's your
second mistake. Where do you think they got it from? From their ability to innovate and think differently?
Get outta here: it's Apple we're talking about, after all. For years, Dark Sky has been lightyears ahead of
Apple's own weather app with the features I just mentioned: and they knew that. Why else would they buy the
app?

Well, I suppose in the previous paragraph I acknowledged how the two apps have almost the same features, but, 
I will still stand with Dark Sky on the basis of one thing: its UI. Yes, you heard me: the somewhat-dated
but nevertheless familiar and intuitive UI. Here it is, on the left, with a comparison to Apple Weather on the right:

Ok, your first impression of Dark Sky's UI may not be great. But, as a long-time user of the app, I've gotten
accustomed to it and know where to find everything. The last time I used Apple's app was in early 2019 before I
moved over to Dark Sky. I will admit, the stock app fits in with iOS better because—get this—it was made by Apple.
Now, let me prove to you how intuitive Dark Sky's UI is by diverting your attention to the very top of the screen.
Dark Sky prominently places both the current temperature and the feels like temperature, while Apple opts to show
the current temperature and the day's high and low temperatures. On the Apple app, I have to scroll down to the 
very bottom to see what it feels like outside, which is especially annoying given that New York is very windy.
Additionally, Dark Sky's expandable weather timeline can show an hourly breakdown, which can also be
modified to show the feels like temperature, precipitation probability and rate, wind speed, humidity, dew point,
UV index, pressure and... you get the idea. The app is customizable. And, when there are clouds or when there is
precipitation, the app changes the color of the hour in the timeline (see the different shades of gray there?) to
reflect that. Apple Weather changes the entire background based on the weather outside, which is overkill and very
distracting. Dark Sky even has a dedicated map tab at the bottom (which is accessible WITHOUT scrolling, unlike
Apple's own app) to view a precipitation and temperature map.

I'm sure by now I've made my case; I hope you can understand the contempt I have for the stock app. As a loyal Dark
Sky user myself, I'm pretty upset about Apple's decision to shut down the app in a few days. Yes, I know that I've 
had over a year and a half to find a suitable alternative, but there simply *isn't* one. The only somewhat-similar app 
is Carrot with the Dark Sky theme applied. But it just isn't the same. Everything good about Dark Sky IS in Carrot, 
but it's all paywalled—the map, the notifications, all of it. I won't be using that app as my replacement come January 
1st. So then what will I use?

Apple Weather.

Yes, I you heard what I said. Even after trashing on it for a good...45 lines? I know, I know, but in reality, what
choice do I have? I'm certainly not about to pay $5 a month for Carrot to replace the $4 Dark Sky app. Just like all
the others in my predicament, I'll switch to Apple's app and just lump it. I may not love it, but hey, maybe after I
use it for two and a half years, I'll get used to it and love it, just like with Dark Sky. And then, just after
everyone gets used to it, they'll remove the stock iOS weather app.

Hopefully that never happens.

Goodbye, Dark Sky. You've served me well.
