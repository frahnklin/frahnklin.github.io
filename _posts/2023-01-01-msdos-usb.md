[Skip to the instructions](#the-instructions).

## The Background ##
Over the break, I've been pretty bored and I wanted to experiment with MS-DOS.
Yes, *the* MS-DOS, released initially in 1981, over 40 years ago (although for
this I installed MS-DOS 6.22, which was released in 1994).

I don't have any spare hard drives around to dedicate to MS-DOS, and even if I
were to erase or partition one, it would still be a couple hundred gigabytes
over the 2 GB limit imposed by MS-DOS' FAT16 filesystem. So, I figured I should
try and install it on a USB stick since they have relatively low capacities.

## The Failures ##
I first approached this by using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie): I have used the
program before and noticed it has an option to make a FreeDOS bootable USB,
or an MS-DOS bootable USB, [given you are using Windows 8.1 or lower](https://superuser.com/a/1228198).
Good thing I was planning to run MS-DOS using a late 2000s-era PC I have, so I
booted my very trusty copy of Windows Vista, ran Rufus, and made the USB stick.
Then I downloaded MS-DOS 6.22 from [here](https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/622)
and extracted the setup files to my USB stick. Hoping for the best, I booted from it
and ran SETUP.EXE.

So that didn't work. I tried downloading an MS-DOS boot floppy [here](https://www.allbootdisks.com/download/dos.html) 
and writing it to a USB with Rufus but to no avail. I tried using the same website's
[MS-DOS ISO files](https://www.allbootdisks.com/download/iso.html), but again, no
luck with that.

## The Success ##
At this point I had spent nearly a day and a half trying to make this work. I couldn't
give up now, which is when it hit me: I could be doing this in a virtual machine.
I fired up VMWare, installed MS-DOS in a virtual machine, used a combination of
`qemu-img` and `dd` to make an ISO, and Rufus'ed it to my USB stick. I booted it, and,
lo and behold, it worked (which I suppose is obvious looking back on it, but regardless,
I was very pleased with my success).

## The Instructions ## 
Here are the concise instructions on how to do this:
1. Download MS-DOS 6.22 [here](https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/622).
2. Install it in your preferred virtual machine application, giving the VM a disk the same
size as your USB stick (the smaller the better; anything >2 GB can't be used by MS-DOS).
3. Install qemu and dd for your OS.
4. Run the following two commands in your OS' terminal (note: change 'vmdk' to the file extension
of your VM's disk):
~~~
qemu-img convert -f vmdk [VMDK file] -o [output].raw
dd if=[output].raw of=[output].iso
~~~
5. Write the ISO to your USB stick.

And that's it! It's really that simple.

## Bonus: Customizing MS-DOS ##
Now that you have your MS-DOS USB stick, you can install your software and games
(and even [Windows 3.1!](#extra-bonus-installing-windows-31)). The way I do this is, on a modern OS, download the setup
files and extract them onto the USB. Then, boot from the USB and install like normal.
[This](https://www.legroom.net/howto/msdos) is a great read on how to fully configure
MS-DOS. But, if you don't want to read it all, the following is a basic idea of how to
customize MS-DOS. Note: use 7-Zip or p7zip to extract these archives.
1. Make a folder called `APPS` on the root of your MS-DOS usb
2. Extract `peditlgt.exe` from the archive [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050206235434/http://www.goldshell.com/pedit/) to `\APPS\PEDIT.EXE`
3. Extract `doskey.com` from the archive [here](http://paulhoule.com/doskey/) to `\APPS\DOSKEY.COM`
4. Extract `ctmouse.exe` from the archive [here](http://cutemouse.sourceforge.net/) to `\DOS\CTMOUSE.EXE`
5. Add
~~~
LOADHIGH C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE /X
LOADHIGH C:\APPS\DOSKEY.COM
C:\DOS\CTMOUSE.EXE /3
PATH=C:\APPS;C:\DOS
~~~
to `AUTOEXEC.BAT` and 
~~~~
SWITCHES=/f
LASTDRIVE=Z
DOS=HIGH,UMB
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM
BREAK=ON
FILES=40
~~~~
to `CONFIG.SYS`

To set up networking and sound, you should read the article. I didn't follow those steps because my
Vista PC's network and sound cards are too new to support MS-DOS.

## Extra Bonus: Installing Windows 3.1 ##
So you say just MS-DOS isn't enough... how about we get Windows 3.1 installed on your USB?
1. Download Windows 3.1 [here](https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-3/31)
2. Extract all the floppy images to `DISK1`, `DISK2`, `DISK3`, etc.
3. Copy these folders to a `\WINSETUP` folder on your USB stick
4. Boot from the USB stick and type `WINSETUP\DISK1\SETUP.EXE` at the command line
5. When prompted, choose a custom installation: this allows you to specify the location of the
setup disk folders since this method does not use floppy disks
6. Plug in a PS/2 mouse if you have one, otherwise you won't have a mouse
7. When asked to confirm hardware, make sure PS/2 mouse is selected

Once setup is finished, you should be able to use Windows 3.1 from your USB stick!
